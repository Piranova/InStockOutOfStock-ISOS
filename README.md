In the wake of the deadly virus COVID-19, panic buying is starting to set in, in most of the cities around the world, its becoming difficult to track commodities and figure which one is still in stock where, so while the medical experts are trying to figure out a medicine for this virus, I thought of helping with my engineering skills. This flutter app which is in-progress will give the following options to users :

1. Create an account and log-in and browse through user comments.
2. User can put in a request for a particular commodity with the details of area where he/she intends to find it.
3. All users will get a notification stating a new request has been generated for this particular commodity.
4. Anyone out shopping can point out and respond saying the commodity is available in this particular store at this address.

To avoid any unnecesary discussions/ negative comments and to make it easier for users to contribute I will not be having any comments sections - its going to be a purely informational app and not a discussion thread.

I also plan to integarte geo-location and the capability for the user to take a picture of the commodity and enter for better validity of the information.

Sample flow of the app would be :

1. User A creates an account and enters request for product x around Toronto.
2. User B gets a notification and spots the product x in store W area Y.
3. User B snaps a picture of the product x and enters the store name and address.
4. App automatically updates the date and non-confidential user info of the comment.
5. User A gets a notification that the product is available in store W area Y on so-and-so date and sets out to get it.


I plan to use flutter for the app and firebase for the back-end but since the app can help a lot of people out there I need a lot of help so any kind of help is appreciated.
